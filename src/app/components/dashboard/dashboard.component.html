        <p class="card-text"> Have you noticed your productivity dropping off? Have you started avoiding spending time with people because they drain you? Burnout is becoming a pandemic among ministry leaders, and you may be at risk of becoming a statistic. Your joy is disappearing, your anger is rising, and your cynicism is starting to become palpable. As ministry leaders, we are always trying to keep up with the avalanche of tasks and issues that come our way every day. This is prime ground for becoming another statistic as a pastor who suffered burnout.

          <p class="card-text"> Risking burnout is a common challenge of ministry leaders, so know you are not alone. Here are some steps you need to take to combat burnout:
            Learn to pace yourself: not everything needs to be done. Just because someone has an emergency doesn’t mean it needs to become your emergency. Focus on the things you need to and don’t take on more than you can handle.
            Delegate to others: Do not be afraid to hand things off to others and allow them to take some of the load. You do not need to do everything, and you shouldn’t. Hand things off to allow others to shine and live out their calling. 
            Take a vacation: If you haven’t taken one in awhile you are way overdue. If you just took a vacation, you need to take another one.
